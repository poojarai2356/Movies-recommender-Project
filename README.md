# movie-recommender-system
A content based movie recommender system using cosine similarity

Movies recommender system is web app which is based on machine learning technology.

We use python programming language to build it. To design user interface we use streamlit python library. The type of this recommender system is content based.

This project is done in 4 stages.
1. In first stage we collect data set here we use TMDB 5000 MOVIES dataset and then we perform data preprocessing.
2. In 2nd stage we build a model using ml. 
3. In 3rd stage we build a website
4.  In the last stages we deploy this site with heroku deployment.

By this project user can find similar movies based on giving movie name. Similar movies are shown on the website with their movies poster
